>Fortiche Productions made a music video named "Get Jinxed" for Riot in 2013. It already features Jinx and the city of Piltover. Riot was so impressed by the work that they asked Fortiche to make an animated series,
>which took them several years to create. After the release of season one, Riot announced that there will be a second season and that it will take less time to produce.
